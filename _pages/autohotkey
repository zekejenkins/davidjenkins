## AutoHotkey Projects

Here are some projects where I used AutoHotkey to automate repetitive tasks:

1. **[Project 1](https://github.com/zekejenkins/ahk-scripts)**: Custom keyboard shortcuts for workflow optimization.
2. **[Project 2](https://github.com/zekejenkins/ahk-tool)**: A GUI-based automation tool built with AHK.
