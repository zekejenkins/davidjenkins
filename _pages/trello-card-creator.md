## Overview

This project automates the creation of Trello cards using data from a Google Sheet. Leveraging Google Apps Script and the Trello API, the script reads spreadsheet rows and maps them to Trello lists, ensuring seamless task management for teams.

By implementing this solution, I was able to:
- Automate card creation in Trello based on structured data.
- Dynamically match spreadsheet rows to corresponding Trello lists.
- Streamline project management by reducing manual work.
