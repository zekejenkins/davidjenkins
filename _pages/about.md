#Welcome to My Data Analytics Portfolio!

##What I'm Currently Doing
I’m David Jenkins, a dynamic professional combining expertise in data analytics, process improvement, and storytelling. In my current role as Assistant Director of Administrative Program Support at the University of Notre Dame, I focus on analyzing and enhancing processes within the financial aid office. Using tools like SAP Business Objects, PL/SQL, PowerQuery, Tableau, and Microsoft Excel, I create dashboards and reports that transform data into actionable insights.

I integrate Scrum and Agile methodologies to manage projects efficiently, fostering collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement within our operations. Additionally, I’ve developed automations using Python, VBA macros, and AutoHotkey, significantly increasing productivity and streamlining workflows. These practices allow me to drive innovation and ensure that solutions are both scalable and sustainable.

Outside of work, I serve as the chair of the fundraising committee for the LGBTQ Center of South Bend, where I’ve raised over $10,000 through events and increased recurring donations by 239% within a year. These experiences highlight my passion for blending data-driven strategies with community impact.

##Previous Experience
My journey to becoming a data-driven problem solver has been as diverse as it has been fulfilling. I began my academic career at Eastern Kentucky University, double-majoring in International Business and Spanish, with a minor in French. A semester abroad at École Supérieure de Commerce de Rennes enriched my studies, exposing me to B2B business, luxury marketing, and advanced French. I later transferred to the University of Kentucky, completing my bachelor’s in Spanish to graduate on time and avoid financial strain.

Professionally, I’ve worn many hats, each building a foundation for my analytical mindset and adaptability. I started at the U.S. Department of Education as a bilingual call representative, advancing to a support agent role that introduced me to mentorship and training. Later, at the University of Cincinnati, I became a Senior Financial Aid Advisor, managing study abroad agreements and implementing data-driven initiatives like Satisfactory Academic Progress evaluations.

Over the years, I’ve cultivated a passion for self-directed learning, teaching myself SQL, SAP Business Objects, and data visualization tools through platforms like Udemy and YouTube. My roles have consistently involved training colleagues, ensuring data governance and compliance, and using analytics to present insights to leadership.

##Future Goals
My ultimate goal is to continue growing as a professional who thrives on learning and exploration. Whether it’s diving into a new dataset, analyzing financial trends, or solving complex business challenges, I’m driven by the opportunity to understand processes, uncover insights, and create meaningful solutions.

I aspire to work in roles where I can blend analytical expertise with strategic thinking, whether that’s as a data analyst, financial analyst, or consultant. I’m excited about the chance to collaborate with diverse teams, tackle dynamic problems, and leverage my skills in data visualization, process improvement, and storytelling to deliver impactful results.

In the future, I aim to deepen my expertise in advanced analytics tools, financial modeling, and consulting methodologies, while staying committed to continuous learning. I believe that curiosity and adaptability are the keys to success, and I’m eager to apply these traits to drive value for organizations and their stakeholders.
