Welcome to my data analytics portfolio! I’m David Jenkins, a dynamic professional with a diverse background in business, language, and analytics. My journey to becoming a data-driven problem solver is as unique as it is fulfilling.

I began my academic career at Eastern Kentucky University, where I double-majored in International Business and Spanish while minoring in French. My passion for global perspectives took me abroad to École Supérieure de Commerce de Rennes, where I studied B2B business, luxury marketing, and advanced French. Later, I transferred to the University of Kentucky and completed my bachelor’s degree in Spanish, a decision influenced by my determination to graduate on time without additional financial strain.

My professional path started with a pivotal role at the U.S. Department of Education, where I worked as a bilingual call representative for student loans. Over three summers, I advanced to a support agent role, guiding and training colleagues. This experience laid the foundation for my focus on process improvement and mentorship, which has been a hallmark of every position I’ve held.

After earning my bachelor’s, I joined the University of Cincinnati as a financial aid advisor and began my MBA. A promotion to Senior Financial Aid Advisor recognized my organizational and analytical skills. My responsibilities grew to include managing complex projects like study abroad agreements and data-driven initiatives like Satisfactory Academic Progress evaluations. This role cemented my passion for leveraging data to solve challenges and improve operations.

Currently, as an Assistant Director, I’ve embraced my love for learning and innovation. I’ve taught myself SQL (PL/SQL), mastered SAP Business Objects for creating queries, reports, and dashboards, and trained colleagues in data governance and compliance. I’m proficient in Excel and constantly explore new ways to use technology to enhance efficiency. Whether automating workflows, analyzing data to uncover actionable insights, or presenting findings to leadership, I’m always focused on driving impact through data.

Beyond analytics, I’ve cultivated leadership and mentorship throughout my career, from training colleagues in the workplace to serving as a subject matter expert in every role I’ve held. My professional journey includes a wide range of experiences—from barista to financial aid advisor to social media marketing consultant—each contributing to my adaptability and well-rounded perspective.

I recently completed my MBA at Indiana University with a focus on business analytics. During my studies, I honed skills in data visualization, analysis, and storytelling to drive meaningful insights. This portfolio reflects my passion for data, commitment to continuous learning, and dedication to making data work for people and organizations.

Thank you for exploring my journey and work. Let’s connect and create data-driven solutions together!
