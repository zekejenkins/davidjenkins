## Overview

This project uses the [**Advertising Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashydv/advertising-dataset) from Kaggle to explore the relationship between advertising expenditures (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and sales performance. The analysis involves scatterplots, regression modeling, and insights to optimize advertising budgets.

By completing this analysis, I was able to:
- Quantify the relationship between total advertising spend and sales.
- Determine which advertising medium has the greatest impact on sales.
- Provide actionable insights for reallocating advertising budgets.
- Predict sales performance under different budget scenarios.

## Features

- **Scatterplot Analysis**:
  - Visualizes the relationship between advertising spend and sales.
  - Includes Total Ad Spend vs. Sales and medium-specific plots (e.g., TV, Radio, Newspaper).
- **Regression Modeling**:
  - Predicts sales using ad spend variables.
  - Measures the significance of each advertising medium.
- **Actionable Insights**:
  - Identifies the most effective ad spend strategy.
  - Recommends reallocating budget from Newspaper to TV and Radio.

## Regression Results

### Summary Statistics:
- **R²**: 0.9026 (90.26% of variation in sales explained by ad spend).
- **Adjusted R²**: 0.9011 (adjusted for predictors).
- **Standard Error**: 1.66 (low residual error).

### Total Ad Spend vs. Sales:
